#  This file initially created using the 'Perl' option when the
#  repository was initially created in GitHub.  We merged with that
#  rules from the .gitignore generated by module-starter.  There are
#  no doubt redundancies and surpurflous entries that need to be
#  edited out.
#
#  We also added 'extended' rules for turds left behind by our own
#  favorite tools and work habits.
