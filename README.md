## To-Do ##

- Would like to do keyword substition with Git, but this feature is
  not built-in.

    <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Does_Git_have_keyword_expansion.3F>

  However it can still be done if we roll our own scripts.  For ideas,
  see:

    <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Keyword-Expansion>
